# HW3 Draft (Needs to be more fleshed out)
Mirrored the 4 parts in Brown’s HW3, but it may make sense to change this around. 


## Part 1: Scrutinizing Strings
Task 1: Write a function valid-name that takes a single String of a first and last name separated by a space, and a String for the desired initials (ie BR for Bob Ross). The function returns true if the name is valid and false if the name is invalid. A name will be valid if the first and last name match the desired initials, there is a single space between them and the name does not contain the character “!”. 

Take a look at the string [documentation](https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/strings.html) for some helpfull functions.  

Task 2: Write out a few tests to make sure the function works as intended. In a comment briefly explains what kind of names that we see in the real world and invalid inputs this function would not account for. 

- Names that are hyphenated or multipart (like David Van Horn)
- Inputs that contain other invalid characters (How to decide what's valid character for a name)


## Part 2: Checks and Tests  
Imagine you worked at an amazing university called DMU and assigned a project to a large group of computer science students. You ask them to make a function check-date which checks if a given string is a valid date. A valid date has the format MM/DD/YYYY where MM is the month, DD is the date and YYYY is the year (all M’s D’s and Y’s are numerical digits). Since you want to be able to grade all the projects fairly and quickly, you decide to create a check block to test that the student's code produces the correct results. 

**You are not writing the check-date function yourself, only tests for it!**

Task 3
Create a check block with tests to determine if a provided implementation of check-date is working as intended. Pyret will run your tests against several versions of check-data that we have written and display the number of faulty implementations you have eliminated. 

Task 4 
In a comment summarize your strategy and how it may be applicable to writing future tests. 

- Should this go in a different assignment, can’t really build creating tests into it? 
- Figure out how to do the testing (Brown had )
 





## Part 3: Setting the Table
A streaming company Metrix has tasked you with creating a function to provide movie recommendations based on user’s profiles and preferences. Write a function movie-recommend that takes a row of the table provided and outputs if the user is likely to enjoy this movie. 
Metrix’s research has shown that the following criteria will lead a user to enjoying a movie:

- The movie came out after the user was 5 years old
- The movie has one of their favorite movie stars 
- If the user is under the age of 15 do not recommend horror movies 
- The score needs to be at least 5.0 if the movie is made by the user’s favorite studio, but must be at least 6.5 if made by someone else

Here is a part of the table that we will be using:

```
movie = table: name :: String, rating :: String, genre :: String, released :: String, score :: Number, director :: String, writer :: String, star :: String, company :: String, runtime :: Number
    row: "The Shining",	"R",	"Drama",	"June 13, 1980 (United States)", 8.4, "Stanley Kubrick","Stephen King","Jack Nicholson",	"Warner Bros.",	146	
end  
```

_Constants or give input as parameters?_
```
AGE = 30
FAVORITE_STARS = “Nicolas Cage, Liam Neeson, Leslie Cheung, Colin Firth, Scarlett Johansson ” 
FAVORITE_COMPANY = “Warner Bros.”
```

Task 5 
Create a function (with a descriptive name) that checks for each of the conditions provided above. 

Task 6:
Use the functions you made in Task 5 to make movie-recommend 

Remember: it may be a good idea to test each function individually to make sure they all work, before trying them all together. 

Task 7: pick a field we had not yet used and add something to check. 



**Potential Issue:**

Currently giving “some(“R”)”  for rating and some(“XYZ”) for other columns because we have elements of the table that are empty 
	- Do we want to deal with Option types? 
	- Do we want to hand pick the data so all rows are full?
	- Do we want to sanitize the table in some way?   

Task 8 and 9 may makes sense based on what has been covered so far (fall 2022 did not have filter and lambdas yet but Spring 2023 does)
Task 8:
Follow the [documentation](https://www.pyret.org/docs/latest/tables.html#%28part._s~3atables~3aloading%29 )  for how to import this [table of movies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1j2HqFMM8aW3O48NOYlYmEO3J6Pl44RBrLc_irGcZRxU/edit#gid=2114051096)from Google sheets. 

Task 9: 
Find all movies in the provided table that are rated “G” or “PG” and is shorter than 100 minutes. 





## Part 4: Metrix vs Netflix
Task 10
Read this [article](https://www.wired.com/2013/08/qq-netflix-algorithm/) on how netflix's algorithm determines what to recommend to its users. 

Task 11:
Answers the flowing questions: 
- What is the best service you have used at giving you recommendations (music streaming, videos, shopping, etc)?
    -  What specifically did this service do well?
- Do you think it is fine to collect the data that netflix is storing, why or why not?
- What user data should a company not be allowed `to store about its users? 
- Briefly explain what parameters you would consider when trying to design an algorithm for recommending classes to other students. 



## Perhaps for a later assignment: 
- Students find an area they are interested in and find a data file (pyret has support to deal with external tables) to make some interesting observations 
- Search for parameters and gather relevant data
- Some potential examples:
	- All cars in the past 10 years that had a recall 
	- Years some sports team had negative record, but won the championship
